<h1> Voting System </h1> 
<p> To use this voting system, simply run the VotingSystem.java file under /src. </p> 

<p> It will load a GUI for the user. </p>

User can also pick any other file they want to test with under "/testing" directory. </li> <br>

<li><b>Choose Results File Location</b> button will prompt user to pick a directory, where user want to store their file. In this case, user can choose /testing as a directory or any other directory to store the audit, summary, and media file. </li> <br>  

<li><b>Submit</b> button will basically run the election file and it will show the results in the GUI as well as creating a new file called "audit.txt", "summary.txt", and "media.txt" under the directory where user pick to store the result of the election file. </li> <br>
